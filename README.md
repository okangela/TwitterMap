• Implemented a Flask-based web application, displaying the geo-locations of related tweets on Google Map by
filtering keywords and analyzing sentiment using ElasticSearch, Tweepy, SocketIO and Alchemy.

• Used the Amazon SQS to create a processing queue and updated the status processing on each tweet with Kafka.

• Configured AWS EC2 and Elastic Beanstalk to run the web application.
