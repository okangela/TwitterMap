This is the project of Cloud Computing & Big Data, developed by Deyang Yin (dy2331) and Xiangyu Zeng (xz2571).
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The application we built is basically naive. We implemented all the requirements in the simplest way. Both of us do not know anything about the development of front end.
Therefore, we encountered difficulty to make an interactive application. Then we decided to keep the application simple. This is best for us as beginners.

We hope you can like our simple design although this application took us much time.
